\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:conclusions}
We have extended the notions of informative selection, population and sample distributions defined by \cite{pfefferman_1992} to a situation where a spatial process is assumed to have generated the whole population. In particular, a Gaussian random field and two point processes that represent the selection mechanism have been considered. An analysis of the naive estimation of the variogram have been performed, and simulation shows that selection bias is introduced when there is dependence between the superpopulation model and the mechanism selection. Finally, we briefly discussed a possible solution in order to correct the naive estimation in presence of informative selection. This solution is based on the use of the maximum likelihood. Future research will be dedicated to a proper development of such proposal.
